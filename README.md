# Awesome DaVinci Resolve [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of awesome [DaVinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve) plugins, tools, and resources.

Community-curated by [/r/colorists](https://reddit.com/r/colorists) and [/r/davinciresolve](https://reddit.com/r/davinciresolve).

## How entries are chosen

For GitHub-hosted tools, we include a repository if it has **10 or more stars**, or **at least 2 stars and activity within roughly the last two years**. Community submissions (via the form or a pull request) are always included regardless of stars. Non-GitHub resources (vendor sites, stores) are judged on relevance rather than stars.

If a tool isn't listed yet, it hasn't been rejected on merit — it may simply be below this threshold for now and will be reconsidered on a future pass. Please still submit it; maintainer discretion always wins over the automatic threshold. Star counts and "updated" notes reflect the most recent sync and will drift over time.
